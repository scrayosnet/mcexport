//! A Minecraft server Prometheus multi-target exporter.
//!
//! This application uses the [Multi-Target Exporter Pattern](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/)
//! to ping and process each target individually. This improves the error handling, as well as the individual timeouts
//! and overall efficiency. Different targets can be pinged with different protocol versions and varying timeouts
//! independent of each other. Therefore, errors within one ping operation cannot affect other targets and their
//! response and state can be returned directly.
//!
//! Prometheus is responsible for scheduling the probe requests as well as possible, and all configuration is performed
//! within Prometheus as well. Therefore, mcexport has no knowledge regarding the list of targets and their individual
//! timeouts. Instead, the targets are requested one-by-one and the appropriate timeout is taken from a specific header
//! in the request. The processing has to be interrupted some time earlier, to account for latency and handling.
//!
//! The protocol implementation is compatible with all Minecraft: Java Edition servers from version 1.7 up. It is
//! expected that the servers strictly follow the protocol specification and appropriately return the expected values
//! at a given time. If the servers fail to do so, the probe requests are marked as unsuccessful.
